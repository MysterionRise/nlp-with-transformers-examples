## Drug Information Leaflet Example

DRUG NAME: Metformin Hydrochloride
BRAND NAMES: Glucophage, Fortamet, Glumetza
DRUG CLASS: Biguanide antidiabetic agent
FDA APPROVAL: 1994

INDICATIONS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents. May be used for polycystic ovary syndrome (off-label).

MECHANISM OF ACTION: Decreases hepatic glucose production, reduces intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:
- Initial: 500mg orally twice daily or 850mg once daily with meals
- Maintenance: 2000-2550mg daily in divided doses
- Maximum: 2550mg daily
- Renal dosing: Contraindicated if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2

ADVERSE EFFECTS:
- Common (>10%): Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort
- Serious: Lactic acidosis (rare but potentially fatal), vitamin B12 deficiency

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
- Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30)
- Metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis
- History of lactic acidosis
- Acute or chronic conditions causing hypoxia

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
- Contrast dye: Withhold 48 hours before and after procedures
- Alcohol: Increased risk of lactic acidosis
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: May increase metformin levels

## Research Abstract - Biomedical

TITLE: CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease: Long-term Outcomes from a Phase I/II Clinical Trial
AUTHORS: Martinez JR, Chen WL, Okonkwo SE, et al.
JOURNAL: New England Journal of Medicine
DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2402891
PUBLISHED: January 2024

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene encoding beta-globin, resulting in abnormal hemoglobin S production. We report 3-year follow-up data from a gene editing trial using CRISPR-Cas9 to reactivate fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression.

METHODS: We enrolled 45 patients with severe SCD (ages 12-35) at 8 centers in the United States and Europe. Autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells were edited ex vivo to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer, then reinfused after myeloablative conditioning with busulfan.

RESULTS: At 36 months, 42/45 patients (93.3%) achieved sustained HbF levels >20% of total hemoglobin. Vaso-occlusive crises decreased from a median of 7.2 per year pre-treatment to 0.5 per year post-treatment (p<0.001). Thirty-eight patients (84.4%) were transfusion-independent at last follow-up. No cases of insertional mutagenesis or off-target editing were detected by whole-genome sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing provides durable clinical benefit in patients with severe sickle cell disease. Longer follow-up is needed to assess durability and late adverse effects.

DRUG: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) 200mg IV
INDICATION: Metastatic melanoma

EVENT DESCRIPTION: 54-year-old male developed grade 3 immune-related pneumonitis after 4th cycle of pembrolizumab. Presented with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and hypoxia (SpO2 88% on room air). CT chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with drug-induced pneumonitis.

MANAGEMENT: Pembrolizumab discontinued. Started methylprednisolone 1mg/kg IV with gradual taper. Patient required supplemental oxygen for 5 days. Symptoms resolved over 3 weeks.

OUTCOME: Recovered with residual mild dyspnea on exertion. Pembrolizumab permanently discontinued per label guidelines. Alternative therapy with ipilimumab/nivolumab combination being considered.

CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT: Probable (Naranjo score 7)
